### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Install the generator

```
$ npm install -g generator-wp-plugin-boilerplate-powered
```
  
NOTE: require git!

### How to use it

```
# Go to the plugin directory of your WP
cd wp-content/plugins
# Run the generator
$ yo wp-plugin-boilerplate-powered
```
